Absolutely — here is a clean, polished **English version** of the GitHub organization README, based on the same structure as the Chinese draft but written natively for an international audience.

If you'd like it to sound more formal, more marketing‑driven, or more minimalistic, I can adjust it anytime.

# 🌐 AterDev Organization

AterDev is a developer‑focused organization dedicated to building **high‑quality .NET tooling, rapid development templates, documentation systems, and engineering‑oriented utilities**. Our mission is to help developers create modern web applications and services with greater speed, clarity, and maintainability.

## 🚀 Core Projects

### **Perigon Series (Flagship Projects)**
- **Perigon.CLI**  
  A rapid backend development tool built on **ASP.NET Core + EF Core**, offering command‑line, Web UI, and IDE MCP support. It leverages code generation and LLM‑assisted workflows to eliminate boilerplate and accelerate development.
- **Perigon.template**  
  A fast, clean project template powered by **ASP.NET Core + Aspire**, designed with best practices and scalable architecture in mind.
- **Perigon.docs**  
  Documentation site for the Perigon ecosystem.
- **Perigon.minidb**  
  A lightweight, file‑based local cache database component.

### **Documentation & Learning**
- **EasyDocs**  
  A C#‑based static documentation/blog generator for building clean, fast content sites.
- **LearnDotNet**  
  A comprehensive .NET learning series covering C#, ASP.NET Core, VS tooling, PowerShell, and practical development workflows.

### **Engineering Tools & Utilities**
- **AspNetCore.OpenApi.Xml**  
  Integrates XML documentation with OpenAPI for improved API clarity.
- **ater.dry.cli / samples**  
  Code generation tools and examples for ASP.NET Core and TypeScript.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**  
  Components for authentication and access control.

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Principles

AterDev projects are primarily built with:

- **C# / .NET / ASP.NET Core**
- **EF Core for data access**
- **Aspire for distributed application modeling**
- **Roslyn analyzers & code generation**
- **Static site generation**
- **Front‑end & back‑end engineering tooling**
- **LLM‑assisted development workflows**

We emphasize:

- **Developer efficiency** — reduce repetitive work and focus on real logic  
- **Clean architecture** — scalable, maintainable project structures  
- **Engineering excellence** — templates, CLI tools, and docs working together  
- **Open source values** — MIT / Apache 2.0 licensing across the ecosystem  

## 🎯 Who We Build For

- Developers building modern .NET web services  
- Teams seeking engineering‑ready templates and tooling  
- Learners exploring C# and .NET fundamentals  
- Engineers who value clarity, automation, and high‑quality architecture

If you want, I can also generate:

- A **shorter** or **more minimal** version  
- A **more polished marketing-style** version  
- A **bilingual (EN + CN)** version  
- A version tailored to **investors**, **contributors**, or **new developers**
